                    Passengers are required to reconfirm flights 72 (seventy two) hours prior to departure with the airline you are travelling with. Passengers are required to arrive at the gate, 3 (three) hours before departure for international travel and 2 (two) hours prior to departure for domestic travel. We are not responsible or liable for flight changes made by the airline. If a passenger misses or does not show for their flight and does not notify the airline prior to missing or no showing the flight, the passenger assumes all responsibility for any change or cancel fee and/or possible loss of ticket value. This no show policy is an airline enforced rule and at their discretion to determine how they will deal with it. However, most airlines look at no shows as a violation of their ticket policies meaning you forfeit any and all funds paid for said ticket. Frequent Flyer Mileage can be accrued on some carriers. Please contact your airline to advise your mileage number. Fares are not guaranteed until ticketed.</td>
